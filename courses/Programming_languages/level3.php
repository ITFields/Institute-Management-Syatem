    <!-- What is the Internet -->
    <h2 id="intro">🌐 What is the Internet?</h2>
    <p>The Internet is a global network of computers and devices that are interconnected using different communication protocols. It allows for the exchange of data, services, and communication among users worldwide.</p>

    <!-- History of the Internet -->
    <h3 id="history">📜 History of the Internet</h3>
    <p>The Internet's origin dates back to the 1960s, where it was first conceptualized as ARPANET, a military communication network. The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 allowed the internet to expand into a user-friendly platform.</p>

    <!-- How the Internet Works -->
    <h3 id="internet-works">⚙️ How the Internet Works</h3>
    <p>The Internet operates through a system of networks that send data through cables, satellites, and radio waves. Data is transmitted in small packets from one computer to another, which is then reassembled by the receiving computer.</p>

    <!-- Web Browsers -->
    <h3 id="browsers">🌍 Web Browsers</h3>
    <p>Web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari are used to access websites. They convert the URLs you type into a protocol that can be understood by your device, fetching the content from the web server.</p>

    <!-- Websites & Web Pages -->
    <h3 id="websites">💻 Websites & Web Pages</h3>
    <p>A website is a collection of related web pages that are identified by a common domain name. Web pages are documents displayed on the browser, typically written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <!-- Domain Names -->
    <h3 id="domains">🔗 Domain Names</h3>
    <p>A domain name is the address of a website. For example, www.example.com is a domain name, which translates into an IP address through a Domain Name System (DNS) server.</p>

    <!-- IP Address -->
    <h3 id="ip">🌐 IP Address</h3>
    <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet. It allows devices to communicate with each other across the network.</p>

    <!-- Internet Protocols -->
    <h3 id="protocols">🔐 Internet Protocols</h3>
    <p>Internet protocols define the rules for communication between devices over the internet. The most common protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and TCP/IP.</p>

    <!-- Search Engines -->
    <h3 id="search-engines">🔍 Search Engines</h3>
    <p>Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo help users find information on the internet by indexing websites and providing relevant search results based on keywords.</p>

    <!-- Internet Security -->
    <h3 id="internet-security">🛡️ Internet Security</h3>
    <p>Internet security involves protecting your data and devices from cyber threats such as viruses, hacking, and phishing. Using firewalls, encryption, and strong passwords are some ways to ensure internet security.</p>

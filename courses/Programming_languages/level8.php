    <!-- Introduction to File Management -->
    <h2 id="intro">📂 Introduction to File Management</h2>
    <p>File management is the process of organizing, storing, and handling files and folders on a computer or cloud system. Effective file management allows users to access, share, and back up their data easily.</p>

    <!-- Organizing Files -->
    <h3 id="organizing">🗂️ Organizing Files</h3>
    <p>Organizing files involves sorting them into folders based on categories such as work, personal, or project-specific. This makes it easier to locate and manage files.</p>

    <!-- File Types -->
    <h3 id="file-types">📁 File Types</h3>
    <p>Common file types include documents (.docx), spreadsheets (.xlsx), images (.jpg, .png), and videos (.mp4). Knowing file types helps ensure compatibility with software programs.</p>

    <!-- Using Folders -->
    <h3 id="folders">📂 Using Folders</h3>
    <p>Folders are containers for organizing multiple files. You can create folders within folders, allowing for nested organization. Always use descriptive names to make it easy to find files later.</p>

    <!-- File Search -->
    <h3 id="search">🔍 File Search</h3>
    <p>Operating systems provide file search functionality, which allows you to locate files by name, type, or content. Learn to use search filters effectively to find files quickly.</p>

    <!-- File Backup -->
    <h3 id="backup">💾 File Backup</h3>
    <p>Back up important files regularly to avoid data loss. Use external drives or cloud services to store backup copies of your files.</p>

    <!-- File Compression -->
    <h3 id="compression">🗜️ File Compression</h3>
    <p>File compression reduces the size of large files or folders. Compressed files can be sent more easily and take up less storage space.</p>

    <!-- File Sharing -->
    <h3 id="sharing">📤 File Sharing</h3>
    <p>Sharing files can be done through email, cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox), or physical devices like USB drives. Ensure the proper permissions are set before sharing.</p>

    <!-- File Security -->
    <h3 id="security">🔒 File Security</h3>
    <p>Ensure the security of your files by using passwords, encryption, and backup copies. Be cautious about malware and phishing attempts that might compromise your data.</p>
